# Lockout-Bot

The lockout bot is a discord bot that basically automates the process of conducting a 1v1 competitve programming tournament. The bot functions by hosting tournaments, registering people, scheduling matches and fetch problems based on the difficulty level specified from two of the most popular CP websites, Codeforces and atcoder.
